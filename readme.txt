== Description ==

**Colorlib 404 Customizer** is a free WordPress plugin that allows you to create a custom and stylish 404 page quickly via the Live Customizer. This amazing plugin offers you the possibility to edit and customize the 404 page so you can match it to your website’s design. Colorlib 404 Customizer is exceptionally easy to use and it **does not** require custom coding or technical skills. All the customizations for the 404 page are done strictly through the Live Customizer.

All websites usually come with a default 404 page already included, but it looks a bit more professional if you customize your own. Not all visitors know what the 404 error message stands for so you could even replace it with a friendlier and more proficient one.  Even if it would be ideal not to have errors on your website, you cannot escape 404 errors which make 404 pages important.

Most themes do not have specific customizing options for the 404 page and if you want to change it you have to edit that page’s template and the styling files. This is where Colorlib 404 Customizer comes in! Using Colorlib 404 Customizer you no longer have to code – just install and activate the plugin then go to **Appearance > Customize > Colorlib 404 Customizer Settings** and start creating your own custom 404 page.  

**Colorlib 404 Customizer Settings comes with pre-built 404 page templates** that you can choose from if you don’t feel like creating your own. You get 20 beautifully designed and custom 404 page templates, and of course each one can be easily customized.

In Colorlib 404 Customizer’s settings you will also find a **Custom CSS** area for those who would like to add their own custom styling and improve the 404 page further. With Colorlib 404 Customizer creating a professional and competent 404 page is easier than ever.
